Title: Multistage Sampling Allocation and Sample Selection
Description: Multivariate optimal allocation for different domains in one and two stages stratified sample design. 'R2BEAT' extends the Neyman (1934) – Tschuprow (1923) allocation method to the case of several variables, adopting a generalization of the Bethel’s proposal (1989). 'R2BEAT' develops this methodology but, moreover, it allows to determine the sample allocation in the multivariate and multi-domains case of estimates for two-stage stratified samples. It also allows to perform both Primary Stage Units and Secondary Stage Units selection. This package requires the availability of 'ReGenesees', that can be installed from <https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees>.
